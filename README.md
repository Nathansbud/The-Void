# U1_Project1_Zack-
This project is a text adventure called "The Void."
So, this project is a WIP, but due to the setup of the buttons, it can be hard to see which paths work and which haven't yet been made.
In order to make things easier to navigate, the following paths are functioning:

On the intro screen, all paths work. Doing Nothing three times works, though once Do Nothing is pressed, you cannot navigate off that path.
The same is true for Go North (and East, to some extent, though a little variance is being made at the moment). Go South can be pressed 
4 times, I believe (the rest hasn't been made yet), as can Go South twice, followed by Go East, Descend, and Go West. The path with the 
most progress at the moment is Go West, as you can Go West, then Enter Cave (or turn around by hitting Go East), and once Enter Cave is 
pressed, Run Further Into Cave, Attempt to Communicate, and Grab Rocks all work (though only Grab Rocks will allow you to continue for now). 
You can then sleep, and Wake Up (all buttons work for this). From this onwards (what I really should have done for the other paths), you 
can only go in one direction until you press Interrupt Ceremony (marked by the buttons having placeholder names), at which point you can
go on of the paths I believe.

Sorry for the lack of order and logic in how I created the pathways, I did it based on how interested I was at the current time. This is 
very much unfinished, so treat it thusly. Apologies in advance!
